#Drum Kit Website

An interactive drum kit built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lets users play different drum sounds using either mouse clicks or keyboard keys.

ðŸ”§ Features Click on on-screen drum buttons to play corresponding sounds.

Use your keyboard to trigger drum sounds (e.g., 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', etc.).

Visual feedback animations on button press.

Uses the DOM API to attach click and keydown event listeners.

Clean and responsive UI â€“ works on desktop and mobile.

ðŸš€ How It Works Each drum button is linked to a specific sound (like kick, snare, tom, crash).

Event listeners detect when a button is clicked or when a specific key is pressed.

Based on the input, the matching .wav file is played using the Audio object in JavaScript.

A brief animation is added to show visual feedback when the drum is played.
